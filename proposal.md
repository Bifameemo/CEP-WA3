# General description of project
> Building a store management system game

# Goals of project
> To create a game that runs smoothly without bugs or loopholes

# Listing of features
> - A daily bus brings in 4-7 customers, of which players must choose at least 3 to let into the store
> - Each customer has a list of items that they wish to buy and sell to the player
> - Players can choose to interact with their customers in any order, and buy or sell products to them
> - For each product that the player sells to customers, they gain score corresponding to the product sold
> - At the end of the day, the player lets their customers out and pays $X in expenses (X is to be balanced at a later date)
> - If all customers had been interacted with at least once, the player gains 1 rating
> - Otherwise, the player loses 1 rating for neglecting their customer(s)
> - The game ends and the player loses when their rating or balance drops below 0, in which case they have to file for bankruptcy
> - The player wins when their score exceeds Y (Y is to be determined at a later date), in which case they have started a successful business!
